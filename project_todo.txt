TODO CODE:
[ ] IPFS GUI --> SWING GUI --> TRY TO COPY GITHUB DESKTOP + IPFS GUI (WHERE TO SHOW THE NUMBER OF PEERS CONNECTED)
[X] IPFS VCS FOLDER --> HTML/CSS/JS TO CREATE A WEB PAGE TO SEE ALL FILES
[-] APPLICATION CACHE --> NEED CACHE TO STORE CURRENT DIRS OF FOLDERS TO TRACK AND WHAT BRANCH IS BEING WORKED ON.
[X]GIT PUSH/CLONE support --> making an ipfs link a git link
  --> git unix commands:
  ```
  ipfs git
  cp -r <.git folder> <location and name of new folder>
  cd <to new folder>
  git update-server-info
  cp objects/pack/*.pack .
  git unpack-objects < ./*.pack
  rn ./*.pack (need to find a way to force yes)
  ipfs add -r
  done
  ```
  --> need to find windows commands (or add unix commands to path)
  --> need to figure out how to use command executor for multi line commands

[:(]GIT OTHER support --> IPVC on a git link (IPVC is slow), HTTP SERVER (IPFS on this server) hosting a git link --> the server will just redirect the link

[X] = done (maybe just need to tidy it up)
[-] = kind of done... just need to implement it!!
[!] = want to do next!!
[:(] = could not complete in time (future plans)

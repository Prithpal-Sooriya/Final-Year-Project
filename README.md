# UWE Computer Science Final Year Project.<br/>Version Control System using IPFS.

This is my final year project that I have developed at the University of the West of England.
<br/>The idea was to create a peer-to-peer versioning system, thus (after some research) I found the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) - a useful protocol/tool to use as the backbone for this project.

## Outcome of this project

This project was a challenging and fun project to base my dissertation on. I have learnt alot from this project, particularly best practices and code maintainability as well as the IPFS project!

This project is currently on hiatus, however I am still keen to see where IPFS goes in the future.

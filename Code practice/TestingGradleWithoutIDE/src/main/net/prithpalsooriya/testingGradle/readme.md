# how gradle works
- gradle isnt maven (just to clarify)
- need to have nested folders inside src (usually reverse url)
  - important!!

- java is not really that nice to program for in a text editor --> nicer to have an ide!!

2 parts for gradle -> project and task (and can build different things for them)

- .gradle files are groovy type code!!
  - so can use groovy scripts

`gradle init` will initialise gradle for a project

# nevermind, cmd refuses to work!
